# Schema Stitching demos

Self-guided examples of [Schema Stitching](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/stitch-combining-schemas) doing awesome things. Focuses on the new (GraphQL Tools v6+) stitching using [type merging](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/stitch-type-merging), not legacy [Apollo Stitching](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/migrating-from-stitching/).
